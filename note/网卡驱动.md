交换机转发方式:

1. 存储转发: 检查以太网数据帧末尾的 fcs 位后再转发,可以避免发送由于冲突而破坏的帧或噪声导致的错误帧
2. 直通转发: 不需要接收整个帧,只需要得知目标地址即可开始转发

包接收:

In the general case, packet reception consists of recognizing the presence of a packet on the wire, performing address filtering, storing the packet in the receive data FIFO, transferring the data to a receive buffer in host memory, and updating the state of a receive descriptor

Software adds receive descriptors by writing the tail pointer with the index of the entry beyond the last valid descriptor. As packets arrive, they are stored in memory and the **head pointer** is incremented by hardware. When the head pointer is equal to the tail pointer, the ring is empty. Hardware stops storing packets in system memory until software advances the tail pointer, making more receive buffers available.

The receive descriptor head and tail pointers reference 16-byte blocks of memory. **Shaded boxes in the figure represent descriptors that have stored incoming packets but have not yet been recognized by software**. Software can determine if a receive buffer is valid by reading descriptors in memory rather than by I/O reads. Any descriptor with a non-zero status byte has been processed by the hardware, and is ready to be handled by the software







DMA:

The DMA engine handles the receive and transmit data and descriptor transfers between the host memory and the on-chip memory.

In the receive path, the DMA engine transfers the data stored in the receive data FIFO buffer to the receive buffer in the host memory, specified by the address in the descriptor. It also fetches and writes back updated receive descriptors to host memory.

In the transmit path, the DMA engine transfers data stored in the host memory buffers to the transmit data FIFO buffer. It also fetches and writes back updated transmit descriptors

New descriptors are added to the ring by writing descriptors into the circular buffer memory region and moving the ring’s tail pointer. The tail pointer points one entry beyond the last hardware owned descriptor (but at a point still within the descriptor ring)

The hardware tail register points one beyond the last valid descriptor





The transmit descriptor ring is described by the following registers:(就是上面的环形队列)

- Transmit Descriptor Base Address registers (TDBAL and TDBAH)

  These registers indicate the start of the descriptor ring buffer. This 64-bit address is **aligned on a 16-byte boundary** and is stored in two consecutive 32-bit registers. TDBAL contains the lower 32-bits; TDBAH contains the upper 32 bits. Hardware ignores the lower 4 bits in TDBAL.

- Transmit Descriptor Length register (TDLEN)

  This register determines the number of bytes allocated to the circular buffer. This value must be **128 byte aligned**.

- Transmit Descriptor Head register (TDH)

  This register holds a value which is an offset from the base, and indicates the in–progress descriptor. There can be up to 64K descriptors in the circular buffer. Reading this register returns the value of “head” corresponding to descriptors already loaded in the output FIFO

- Transmit Descriptor Tail register (TDT)

  This register holds a value which is an offset from the base, and indicates the location beyond the last descriptor hardware can process. This is the location where software writes the first new descriptor.



描述符限制:

As for receives, the number of on-chip transmit descriptors buffer space is 64 descriptors.

## EEPROM

The PCI/PCI-X Family of Gigabit Ethernet Controllers uses an EEPROM device for storing product configuration information.





The Ethernet controller’s address space is mapped into four regions with PCI Base Address Registers described in Table 13-2. These regions are shown as follows.

| Internal registers and memories (including PHY)   | Memory | 128 KB      |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| Flash (optional)                                  | Memory | 64 - 512 KB |
| Expansion ROM (optional)                          | Memory | 64 - 512 KB |
| Internal registers and memories, Flash (optional) | I/O    | 8 Bytes     |





## 寄存器

All registers in the Ethernet controller are defined to be 32 bits, **should be accessed as 32-bit double words**, and are aligned on a 64-bit boundary. There are exceptions to this rule:

- PCI configuration registers
- I/O space registers (IOADDR and IODATA) are aligned on 32-bit boundaries
- Register pairs where two 32-bit registers make up a larger logical size
- Accesses to Flash memory (through Expansion ROM space or secondary Base Address Register space) can be byte, word, double word or quadword accesses.
- Reserved bit positions. Some registers contain certain bits that are marked as “reserved.” These bits should never be set to a value of 1b by software. Reads from registers containing reserved bits can return indeterminate values in the reserved bit positions unless read values are explicitly stated. When read, these reserved bits should be ignored by software
- Reserved and/or undefined addresses. Any register not explicitly declared in this specification should be considered to be reserved and should not be written. Writing to reserved or undefined register addresses can cause indeterminate behavior. Reads from reserved or undefined configuration register addresses can return indeterminate values unless read values are explicitly stated for specific addresses.
- Initial values. Most registers define the initial hardware values prior to being programmed. **In some cases, hardware initial values are undefined and are listed as such via the text “undefined,” “unknown,” or “X.” Some such values might need setting through EEPROM configuration or software in order for proper operation to occur**; this need is dependent on the function of the bit. Other registers might cite a hardware default that is overridden by a higher precedence operation. Operations that might supersede hardware defaults can include a valid EEPORM load, completion of a hardware operation (such as hardware Auto-Negotiation), or writing of a different register whose value is then reflected in another bit.

For registers that should be accessed as 32-bit double words, partial writes (部分写入,less than a 32-bit double word) is ignored. Partial reads return all 32 bits of data regardless of the byte enables

Partial reads to read-on-clear registers (for example, ICR) can have unexpected results since all 32 bits are actually read regardless of the byte enables. Partial reads should not be performed





### Memory-Mapped Access to Internal Registers and Memories

The internal registers and memories can be accessed as direct memory-mapped offsets from the base address register (BAR0 or BAR0/BAR1, see Section 4.1). Refer to Table 13-2 for the appropriate offset for each specific internal register.



The IODATA register must always be written as a DWORD access when the IOADDR register contains a value for the Internal Register and Memories (00000h - 1FFFCh).

The IODATA register can be written as a byte, word, or Dword access when the IOADDR register contains a value for the Flash (80000h - FFFFFh). In this case, the value in IOADDR must be properly aligned to the data value. Additionally, the lower 2 bits of the IODATA PCI-X access must correspond to the byte, word, or Dword access.Table 13-1 lists the supported configurations:
