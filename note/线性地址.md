As shown in Figure 3-1, segmentation provides a mechanism for dividing the processor’s addressable memory space (called the linear address space) into smaller protected address spaces called segments. Segments can be used to hold the code, data, and stack for a program or to hold system data structures (such as a TSS or LDT).If more than one program (or task) is running on a processor, each program can be assigned its own set of segments. The processor then enforces the boundaries between these segments and insures that one program does not interfere with the execution of another program by writing into the other program’s segments. The segmentation mechanism also allows typing of segments so that the operations that may be performed on a particular type of segment can be restricted.



All the segments in a system are contained in the processor’s linear address space. To locate a byte in a particular segment, a logical address (also called a far pointer) must be provided. A logical address consists of a segment selector and an offset. The segment selector is a unique identifier for a segment. Among other things it provides an offset into a descriptor table (such as the global descriptor table, GDT) to a data structure called a segment descriptor. Each segment has a segment descriptor, which specifies the size of the segment, the access rights and privilege level for the segment, the segment type, and the location of the first byte of the segment in the linear address space (called the base address of the segment). The offset part of the logical address is added to the base address for the segment to locate a byte within the segment. The base address plus the offset thus forms a linear address in the processor’s linear address space.





To translate a logical address into a linear address, the processor does the following:

1. Uses the offset in the segment selector to locate the segment descriptor for the segment in the GDT or LDT and reads it into the processor. (This step is needed only when a new segment selector is loaded into a segment register.)
2. Examines the segment descriptor to check the access rights and range of the segment to insure that the segment is accessible and that the offset is within the limits of the segment.
3. Adds the base address of the segment from the segment descriptor to the offset to form a linear address.

If paging is not used, the processor maps the linear address directly to a physical address (that is, the linear
address goes out on the processor’s address bus). If the linear address space is paged, a second level of address translation is used to translate the linear address into a physical address.

如果分页未开启,则线性地址直接映射到物理地址,如果开启分页,cpu 利用分页机制将线性地址映射为物理地址
